# Eventful Script

This is the README for the VSCode extension "eventful-script". This extension is a syntax highlighter for .eventful files for the Eventful Discord event bot. The script is currently in development, so many changes are expected to be made before finalization of script features.

## Installation

To install this extension, clone this repository into your `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder. Until the script is finalized this extension will not be published. In the future after publication you will be able to install this as easily as any other visual studio code extension.
